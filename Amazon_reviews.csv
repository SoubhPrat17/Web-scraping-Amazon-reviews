1,Surbhi Garg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera quality is very poor.,  Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.
2,klknow,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dead on arrival,"  I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore."
3,abdulkadir garari,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth to buy 6T,  One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.

6,Regidi Mahesh Dora,1.0 out of 5 stars,NO WAY GOING TO BE A CUSTOMER OF A COMPANY (Oneplus6T) THAT CANNOT GET NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE CORRECT,"  Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobileThe mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one"
7,Aakash Sinha,5.0 out of 5 stars,OnePlust 6T McLaren Edition - Salute to Speed!,"  This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!"
8,Mumtaz Alam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,"  Battery-Extremely PoorCamera-SatisfactoryLook-GoodWeight-GoodSound-SuperbOverall I would have given it half star,deeply through by it's battery.And even after the replacement,the same problem persists,which means it's a clear cut case of faulty manufacturing.Please don't buy it,if you really love your hard earned money....."
9,Vaibhav Narvaria,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb phone,  After replace the handset issue was resolved. Now i unlocked the speed i need.
